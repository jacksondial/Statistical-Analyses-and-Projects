Our World in Data provides daily updates to their COVID-19 dataset. It contains common metrics for cases, deaths, tests and other variables. We will use that data to create interactive time series charts.


```r
# Use this R-Chunk to import all your datasets!
all<-read_csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv")

#Take a minute to get familiar with the data and the variables
```

## Problem Description: Start with the End in Mind

Let's say we want to visualize the number of new cases per million people for two countries with an interactive chart using dygraphs. It is helpful to know the format dygraphs needs the data in. Unfortunately, it is not in a tidy format ! :(

dygraphs require an xts object as input. Each series on the graph (i.e. each unique line), should be stored in a separate column. The dates are the "index" (kind of like a row name). 

So to show the new cases per million people for two separate countries, I'll need 2 columns. 
Question: is it okay to have additional column in the xts object I feed to dygraphs?

## Data Wrangling


```r
# Use this R-Chunk to clean & wrangle your data!

two_country <- all %>% filter(iso_code == "USA" |
                 iso_code == "GBR") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = iso_code, 
              values_from = new_cases_per_million,
              id_cols = date)
  
#What class of object is two_country currently?

class(two_country)  
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

```r
#Now that we have the dataset in the format dygraphs needs, we will convert it to an xts time series object

myxts <- two_country %>% 
  timetk::tk_xts(date = date)
  
#Can we find the maximum new cases per million for the U.S.?
#myxts %>% 
#  summarise(peak = max(USA)) This does not work because tidyverse doesn't work with xts

max(myxts$USA)
```

```
## [1] 558.343
```

## Data Visualization Together

We'll use this link to learn how to use the dygraphs package.
http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/index.html


```r
#Let's plot the series with an interactive date range selector

dygraph(data = myxts, main = "New Cases per Million People in UK and USA") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("2020-03-01", "2020-11-18"))
```

## Data Visualization in Groups

(Don't bother knitting yet, just run the code in the console. We will knit at the end of class)

Use the code in the R chunk above and add to it in the next chunk. Specifically, add dynamic highlighting, so the series you hover over is given more visual emphasis.Play with some of the options and customize it to the way you like it.


```r
dygraph(data = myxts, main = "New Cases per Million People in UK and USA") %>%

  dyHighlight(highlightCircleSize = 3,
              highlightSeriesBackgroundAlpha = .3,
              hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)

Use the code in the R chunk above and add to it in the next chunk. 

The data is very jaggity/spikey, which makes it somewhat difficult to read. Read the "Roll Periods" section and replot your data using rolling averages. Play around with the period you would like as the default.

## Return to the main class

Let's plot the series for the US and the UK on different charts, but with a linked date range selector. To do this we will need to call dygraphs twice, once for each series.

Also, let's start the chart on April 1st instead of March 1st.


```r
usa_ts <- two_country %>% select(date, USA)
gbr_ts <- two_country %>% select(date, GBR)

#convert the tibble to an xts object
usa_xts <- usa_ts %>% 
  tk_xts(date = date)
gbr_xts <- gbr_ts %>% 
  tk_xts(date = date)
##




dygraph(tk_xts(usa_ts, date_var = date), group = "country") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("2020-04-01", "2020-11-18"))
```
